1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--> Remote repositories are handy whenever you want to store your repo somewhere outside of your local machine, access it from another machine, and/or collaborate with another person and make those files accessible to them.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
—-> Pulling changes manually allows you more control over what is present in your local repo and in your files, so that your files don’t update with changes in the middle of editing and so that you can choose an appropriate time in your workflow to update changes.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you want to use one instead of another?
—-> A branch copies commits from a repository into a separate stream of commits independent from the original from the point of split onwards. A clone copies a repository either from github to your own machine or from one local repo to another. A fork copies a repository and its commits through github into your own list of repositories with a link back to the original. You would fork rather than clone when you want to copy/change a repository when you don’t want to/don’t have permissions to change the original.
